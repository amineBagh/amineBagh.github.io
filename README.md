## 1. Allocating Penalties Faster Than Ever
**Description:**  
This project uses **NLP**, **OCR**, and **fine-tuning** to create a comprehensive system for allocating penalties in real-time. It ensures fairness by automating data extraction, providing real-time notifications, and maintaining an audit trail. The project also incorporates customer preferences and historical rental data for optimized decision-making.

**Key Features:**  
- Real-time penalty notifications.  
- Bias mitigation using machine learning.  
- Interactive dashboards for client insights.  
- Document text recognition using **DocTR**.  
- MongoDB database integration for managing penalties.

## 2. A Knowledge Graph System for Project Management
**Description:**  
This project leverages knowledge graphs to revolutionize project management. By integrating data from multiple sources, it enables users to visualize relationships, track dependencies, and optimize workflows in real time. The system is designed for scalability and adaptability, making it suitable for projects of any size or complexity.

**Key Technologies:**  
- **GNN/GCN:** To model complex relationships and dependencies in project data, providing deep insights into task interconnections and resource allocation.  
- **Llama Model:** For advanced natural language understanding and generation, enabling intelligent query processing and contextual suggestions for project managers.  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Combines retrieval techniques with generative AI to provide accurate, context-aware answers by pulling relevant project-related information dynamically.

**Key Features:**  
- Semantic representation of tasks, resources, and timelines using knowledge graphs.  
- Real-time dependency tracking with GNN/GCN for optimized project workflows.  
- Enhanced natural language interaction powered by the Llama model.  
- Retrieval-based intelligence via RAG for actionable, context-aware insights.  
- Scalable architecture for dynamic project management needs.  
- Integration with popular project management tools.
