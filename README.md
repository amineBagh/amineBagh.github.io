## Introduction
![Introduction Image](URL_TO_INTRO_IMAGE)

## Business Objectives
- **Prevent unfairness caused by human intervention.**
- **Notify drivers of penalties in real-time.**
- **Automate data extraction from penalties.**
- **Maintain a detailed audit trail:** Record every action and decision in the penalty management process.
- **Rental Decision Support:** 
  - Decide whether to rent the car.
  - Incorporate customer preferences and historical rental data to personalize rental recommendations and optimize pricing strategies.

## Data Science Objectives
- **Deep Learning for Data Extraction:** Implement algorithms to extract penalty data.
- **Email API Integration:** Notify clients with detailed fine information.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Develop ML algorithms to identify and mitigate biases in penalty management decisions.
- **Database Creation:** Use MongoDB to match penalty key features with the actual CSV document.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Provide client-related statistics and insights.
